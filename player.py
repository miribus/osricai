        # "escape" - ability to withdraw from combat without taking damage
        # "dodge" - ability to nullify (non magic) damage without 'escaping'
        # "unlock" - ability to open a non-magical locked barrier
        # "smashdoor" - ability to open a non-magical locked barrier, while taking damage
        # "poison" - ability to reduce damage from poisons, nullify it, or deal poisonous damage
        # "find_secret" - will reveal any secrets (non-magical) within the room/hallway
        # "find_trap" - will reveal any traps deemed non-magical and nullify effect
        # "influence" - will have some determination on NPC and perhaps monster reactions
        # "charm" - will have significant determination on NPC and monster reactions
        # "know_tricks" - will reveal other unique detail not covered by secrets, or traps
        # "resistance" - generally, damage reduction (or nullification) to ALL effects
        # "magical" - generally a modifier for above items as well as a highly contextual subset of abilities and NPC modifications to be determined later.
