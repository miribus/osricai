  "chapter": "HIRELINGS AND HENCHMEN",
  "description": "As adventurers amass wealth and renown in this medieval realm, they increasingly require the semi-permanent services of non-player characters. These retainers fall into two broad classes: hirelings, who are generally unclassed, zero-level individuals incapable of advancement, and henchmen, who are classed and may gain experience over time.",
  "serviceRequirements": {
    "equipment": "In almost all cases, hirelings and henchmen must be outfitted entirely by those who employ them. If a character wishes to hire an already-equipped retainer, the value of that equipment should be tendered as a stipend prior to the commencement of service.",
    "species": "It is typically assumed that hirelings are human. Should one seek the services of non-human retainers, the associated costs, terms, and availability must be determined in keeping with the setting’s particular lore and economic values."
  },
  "standardHirelings": {
    "description": "Short-term services of simple craftsmen and labourers are readily procured in large settlements, with even small villages offering some form of such help. However, securing a retainer for an extended duration—especially when considerable travel is involved—can be challenging. For lengthy engagements, only about one in six hirelings might initially agree. The offer of additional wages, such as an extra two or three days’ pay, may increase that probability to roughly one in two.",
    "paymentGuidelines": "Rates of payment do not factor the cost of materials needed for construction or crafting. As a rough rule for item creation, materials might cost around ten percent of the finished product’s price. Moreover, monthly payment rates assume that the retainer is provided with lodgings and that their day-to-day needs—food, shelter, etc.—are already met; if not, adjustments must be made by the game master."

The total number of henchmen a character may command is generally limited by his/her charisma score.",
    "demographics": "The number of available henchmen in a locale depends on the total population and its predisposition toward attracting adventurer types. For instance, a prosperous trading city with 30,000 inhabitants might have 300 characters capable of level advancement, yet only 1 in 10 may be available and interested in serving as henchmen.
