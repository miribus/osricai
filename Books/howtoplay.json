  "category": "HOW TO PLAY",
  "sections": {
    "The First Time": {
      "Overview": "After players create their characters and record ability scores and other details on character sheets, the GM sets the stage by describing the game situation. The description may assume that the adventuring party has already formed or might introduce characters as strangers coming together. The GM provides details about the immediate surroundings—be it a tavern, a wild moor, or a dark stairwell—while additional world information might be reserved for gradual discovery.",
      "Player Interaction": "Players announce their characters' actions (e.g., 'Leofric climbs the slope with his sword drawn' or 'I light my torch and head down the stairs'), and the GM responds by describing what the characters perceive: the sights, sounds, smells, and tactile sensations of the environment. NPC interactions may be played out directly by the GM or summarized."
    },
    "Time Measurement": {
      "Overview": "Game time is abstracted into specific units that differ from real-world time. The passage of time is tracked in turns, rounds, and segments, which impact in-game events such as weapon durability, food consumption, wound healing, and the appearance of wandering monsters.",
      "Time Units": {
        "Turn": "10 minutes (commonly used in non-combat, dungeon exploration scenarios)",
        "Round": "1 minute",
        "Segment": "6 seconds"
      },
      "Usage and Importance": "The GM generally tracks the passage of time, though sometimes a trusted player may be delegated this responsibility. Time measurement is important because it affects various aspects of gameplay—torches burn down, food can be consumed, and injured characters may heal during rests. In dangerous environments like dungeons or wildernesses, the GM will perform periodic checks for wandering monsters (typically every few turns, hours, or days), which punishes delay and rewards efficient play."
    },
    "movement": {
      "Movement Rates": {
      "Description": "Movement rates represent the distance a character or monster can move in one minute (or one round)."
    },
    "Cautious Movement": {
      "Description": "When moving cautiously (e.g., stalking or mapping), the character's normal movement rate is divided by 10.",
      "Example": "A party with a movement rate of 90 ft moves 90 ft per turn through a dungeon when moving cautiously."
    },
    "Standard Movement in Combat": {
      "Description": "When not moving cautiously (such as during combat), characters move at their full movement rate. For example, 90 ft in one round."
    },
    "Running": {
      "Description": "Running doubles a character's movement rate. Note that during combat, a full run is only possible when charging or fleeing."
    },
    "Daily Travel Calculation": {
      "Description": "Dividing the movement rate by 5 gives the number of miles the character can travel in a day at walking speed along level terrain.",
      "Example": "A character with a movement rate of 60 ft can march approximately 12 miles per day, while one with 120 ft can march 24 miles per day."
    },
    "Mounted Movement": {
      "Description": "When mounted, characters use the movement rate of their horse (or mount) rather than their own."
    }
    }
  },
  "Encumbrance and Base Movement Rate": {
    "description": "This section outlines how the weight a character carries affects movement rates and combat readiness. Characters must balance the gear they carry—not only to avoid being encumbered but also to leave room for treasure and to ensure they can move quickly when necessary.",
  "maxCarryingCapacity": "150 lbs plus any additional weight allowed by the character's strength",
  "strengthAllowance": "The extra weight permitted by a character’s strength is subtracted from the standard encumbrance thresholds.",
  "encumbranceTable": [

      "weightRange": "up to 35 lbs",

      "surprise": "No normal bonuses apply (but penalties do); -1 extra penalty"
    }
  ],
  "overEncumbrance": "No movement is possible if attempting to carry more than the adjusted maximum (150 lbs plus strength allowance).",
  "baseMovementNote": "The table assumes a character with a base movement of 120 ft/round. For small races (dwarves, gnomes, halflings), a base move of 90 ft applies (deduct 30 ft from all movement rates, with a minimum of 30 ft) without altering encumbrance effects on surprise or initiative.",
  "armourNote": "Wearing armour sets a maximum movement rate based on its bulk and independently affects the total weight a character carries.",
