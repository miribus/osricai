    "description": "Most monsters use the fighter’s attack matrices, with their Hit Dice (HD) converted to an equivalent level for both attack and saving throw purposes. The following table provides guidelines for converting a monster’s HD into an equivalent level. The same table is used to determine saving throws, though the GM may adjust based on the monster’s abilities, nature, or situational factors.",

    "notes": [
      "By default, monsters save as fighters using the above table. However, if a monster clearly exhibits the abilities of another class, such as a goblin shaman, the GM may opt to use that class’s saving throw matrix instead.",
      "For powerful monsters that duplicate abilities from several classes (for example, a spellcasting dragon), the most favorable (i.e., highest effective) matrix should be used. Typically, the level at which a monster casts spells is determined by its HD; e.g., a magic-using dragon with 11 HD would cast spells as a 12th-level spellcaster, unless noted otherwise.",
      "Huge but unintelligent creatures—such as dinosaurs—may have their effective level reduced for saving throws, and occasionally for attack matrices as well, at the GM’s discretion.",
      "Some creatures receive special effective attack level bonuses. For instance, stirges with 1+1 HD attack as if they were level 5.",
      "The GM should also account for situational or positional bonuses. For example, monsters attacking from a height advantage using spears may warrant an increase of +1 to their effective equivalent level."

    "TURNING UNDEAD": {
      "description": "Clerics and paladins can turn undead—forcing them to flee or, by divine power, causing them to be destroyed. Evil clerics, however, can also choose to control undead instead of turning them. (Note that an evil cleric may even turn a paladin, but cannot destroy a paladin by turning.)",

      "default": "Normally, 2d6 creatures are affected by a Turn Undead attempt.",
      "exceptions": "Exceptions include paladins and Type 13 creatures, of which only 1d2 are affected, and rolls resulting in 'D', which affect 1d6+6 creatures."
    },
    "duration": "Turning lasts for 3d4 rounds.",
    "behavior": "Turned creatures must move away from the cleric at their fastest possible movement rate. They will attack only if something directly blocks their escape, otherwise they make no effort to fight.",
    "holySymbolRequirement": "The cleric or paladin must be holding his or her holy symbol to attempt turning. In most cases this means the holy symbol is the only item in hand—precluding any attacking during that round unless a special exception applies.",
    "turningProcess": "To turn undead, the cleric or paladin rolls a d20 on the Turning Undead Table. If the result is equal to or greater than the number shown on the table, the undead are affected. For evil clerics, a result of 'D' on the table forces the undead under the cleric's control for 24 hours instead of destroying them. If a turning attempt fails, no further turning may be attempted in that encounter. If successful, the cleric may try again on the next round."

    "evilClericControlLimit": "An evil cleric may control undead with a total Hit Dice not exceeding his or her level. For example, a 9th-level evil cleric might be limited to controlling no more than two wights."
